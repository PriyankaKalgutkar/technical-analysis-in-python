# technical-analysis-in-python

Technical Analysis is widely used by traders in the stock market, in order to look at the price and volume trends of stocks, and predict future movements. Technical analysis is based on the assumption that 'History repeats itself'. This means that the future price/volume is likely to follow a similar trend, as it has in the past.

The code in this project calculates a few technical indicators, which mainly focus on the patterns of historical stock prices. The visualizations of these indicators will also be shown, with the Matplotlib library.

The following technical indicators will be calculated :

1. Daily and Cumulative Daily Return
2. Moving Averages
3. Exponential Moving Averages
4. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
5. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
6. Williams % R
7. Ichimoku Cloud

'TA-Lib' is a library that can be used in Python, in order to calculate various technical indicators. This library will be used in the code, for analyzing the indicators.
